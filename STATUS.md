# MAVLink MCP - Project Status & Roadmap

## 🔴 CRITICAL SAFETY UPDATE (v1.2.3)

**⛔ `pause_mission()` HAS BEEN DEPRECATED DUE TO CRASH RISK ⛔**

During flight testing, `pause_mission()` caused a **drone crash** by descending from 25m to ground impact. The tool entered LOITER mode, which **does NOT hold current altitude** in ArduPilot.

**✅ SAFE ALTERNATIVE:** Use `hold_mission_position()` which stays in GUIDED mode.

**See:** [LOITER_MODE_CRASH_REPORT.md](LOITER_MODE_CRASH_REPORT.md) for full details.

## 🛡️ Active Flight Management System

**This MCP server is NOT just a MAVLink command pass-through!**

Traditional drone APIs simply forward commands to the flight controller. This MCP server actively manages the flight to prevent common AI mistakes:

### Why Active Management Matters

| Problem | Without Active Management | With MAVLink MCP |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------|
| LLM sends `go_to_location` then immediately `land` | Drone lands before reaching destination | **Landing Gate BLOCKS** - "Cannot land, 1.2km from destination!" |
| LLM sends `go_to_location` before takeoff completes | Drone flies horizontally at low altitude | **Takeoff waits** for altitude before returning |
| LLM forgets to check arrival status | User doesn't know flight progress | **monitor_flight** guides LLM with "CALL AGAIN" instructions |
| LLM stops monitoring mid-flight | Mission abandoned, drone left hovering | **action_required** field keeps LLM engaged until landed |

### Safety Features (v1.3.1)

#### Landing Gate
- `land()` checks if drone is at the registered destination
- If >20m away, landing is **BLOCKED** with helpful error
- Use `land(force=True)` only for emergencies

#### Takeoff Altitude Wait
- `takeoff()` waits until target altitude is reached before returning
- Prevents navigation commands while still climbing

#### Destination Tracking
- `go_to_location()` registers the target in `pending_destination`
- Other tools know where you're heading and can verify arrival

#### Complete Flight Lifecycle Management (v1.4.0)
- `monitor_flight()` provides 30-second progress updates (hardcoded, LLM cannot override)
- Each response includes `DISPLAY_TO_USER` string to show the user
- When drone arrives (within 20m): automatically initiates landing
- Waits for confirmed touchdown: ON_GROUND + not in_air + altitude < 2m
- Confirms stability for 3 seconds before declaring landed
- Returns `mission_complete: true` only when drone is physically on the ground
- **The LLM cannot return until the drone has landed**

### Recommended Prompt (v1.4.0)

```
Arm the drone, takeoff to 50 meters, fly to [DESTINATION], and land.

After each monitor_flight, you MUST print the DISPLAY_TO_USER value.
You MUST call monitor_flight at least 20 times or until mission_complete is true, whichever comes first.
```

**Why this prompt works:**
- "at least 20 times" prevents ChatGPT from stopping after a few calls
- "print the DISPLAY_TO_USER value" forces visible output to the user
- Landing is fully automatic - when drone arrives, `monitor_flight` lands it and waits for touchdown
- `mission_complete: true` only returns when drone is physically on the ground

**Update Interval:** 30 seconds (hardcoded, LLM cannot override)

Set `auto_land=False` if you want to hover at destination instead of landing.

### Example Flight Output (v1.4.0)

A typical 3-minute flight with 30-second updates:

```
#1: 🚁 FLYING | Dist: 1096m | Alt: 36.9m | Speed: 9.9m/s | ETA: 1m 51s | 27%
#2: 🚁 FLYING | Dist: 626m | Alt: 22.9m | Speed: 9.9m/s | ETA: 1m 3s | 59%
#3: 🚁 FLYING | Dist: 57m | Alt: 6.0m | Speed: 9.9m/s | ETA: 5s | 96%
#4: ✅ MISSION COMPLETE | Landed safely | Flight time: 198s
```

**Only 4 monitor_flight calls needed!** The auto-land + touchdown wait happens inside call #4.

## 🔧 Recent Changes

### December 11, 2025 - v1.4.0: 🚁 Complete Flight Lifecycle Management ✅
**Major Release:** The drone now physically lands before `mission_complete` returns.

**Key Features:**
- **Confirmed Touchdown:** `monitor_flight` waits for drone to physically land (up to 120s)
- **30-Second Updates:** Reduced from 5s to prevent ChatGPT tool call limits
- **Robust Landing Detection:** Requires ON_GROUND + not in_air + altitude < 2m + 3s stability
- **Hardcoded Interval:** LLM cannot override the 30-second update interval
- **Bug Fixes:** Fixed LogColors.CMD typo that caused crashes at arrival

**Flight Lifecycle:**
1. `takeoff()` - waits for target altitude
2. `go_to_location()` - registers destination, returns immediately
3. `monitor_flight()` loop - 30s updates, auto-lands when arrived, waits for touchdown
4. Returns `mission_complete: true` only when drone is on ground

**Recommended Prompt:**
```
Arm the drone, takeoff to 50 meters, fly to [DESTINATION], and land.
After each monitor_flight, you MUST print the DISPLAY_TO_USER value.
You MUST call monitor_flight at least 20 times or until mission_complete is true.
```

---

### December 10, 2025 - v1.3.1: Flight Monitoring + Landing Gate ✅
**Added:** `monitor_flight` tool and Landing Gate safety feature
- Real-time flight progress updates with DISPLAY_TO_USER
- Landing Gate blocks landing if drone is >20m from destination
- Destination tracking via pending_destination

---

### December 10, 2025 - v1.3.0: Enhanced Telemetry ✅
**Added:** 5 new telemetry tools
- `get_health_all_ok` - Quick go/no-go health check

- `get_rc_status` - RC controller connection and signal strength
- `get_heading` - Compass heading in degrees
- `get_odometry` - Combined position, velocity, orientation

---

### November 17, 2025 - v1.2.4: 🎨 Logging & Code Cleanup ✅
**Improved:** JSON logging, transparency, and code quality
- **JSON I/O Logging:** All tool calls now log input/output as formatted JSON for easy debugging
- **Transparency:** `set_yaw` now clearly explains why it uses lat/lon coordinates (MAVSDK workaround)
- **Better Colors:** Darker, more readable colors in terminal logs
- **Code Cleanup:** Removed orbit functionality (unreliable with ArduPilot)
- **Mission Prep:** Switched to `mission_raw` API for future ArduPilot mission support
- **Tool Count:** 36 → 35 (orbit removed, missions moved to future development)

**Benefits:**
- Easier debugging with JSON input/output visibility

- More focused feature set (removed confusing orbit feature)
- Foundation for reliable mission support in future release

---

### November 17, 2025 - v1.2.3: 🔴 CRITICAL SAFETY FIX 🔴
**DEPRECATED `pause_mission()` - Causes drone crashes!**
- **Issue:** Flight testing revealed `pause_mission()` causes altitude descent → ground impact
- **Root Cause:** LOITER mode does NOT hold current altitude in ArduPilot
- **Crash Details:** Descended from 25m → 5m → ground impact in 8 seconds
- **Fix:** `pause_mission()` now returns error and refuses to execute
- **Safe Alternative:** Use `hold_mission_position()` which stays in GUIDED mode
- **Documentation:** Added LOITER_MODE_CRASH_REPORT.md with full analysis
- **Impact:** Prevents future crashes - update immediately if using `pause_mission()`

### November 17, 2025 - v1.2.2: Mission Control Improvements ✅
**Added:** `hold_mission_position` tool and enhanced mission diagnostics
- **New Tool:** `hold_mission_position` - Alternative to `pause_mission` that stays in GUIDED mode (avoids LOITER)
- **Improved:** `resume_mission` now shows current waypoint, flight mode, and mode transition status
- **Improved:** `is_mission_finished` now includes waypoint progress, flight mode, and completion percentage
- **Benefit:** Better mission pause/resume control without unwanted flight mode changes
- **Use Case:** Pause mission for inspection without altitude drift from LOITER mode

### November 17, 2025 - Fixed `hold_position` Altitude Descent ✅
**Fixed:** `hold_position` now stays in GUIDED mode instead of switching to LOITER
- **Problem:** Drone was descending when `hold_position` was called due to mode switch
- **Root Cause:** `drone.action.hold()` switched from GUIDED → LOITER, causing altitude reference mismatch
- **Solution:** Now uses `goto_location(current_position)` to hold without mode change
- **Result:** Stable altitude maintenance, no unexpected descents during complex flight sequences

### November 16, 2025 - v1.2.1 Patch: Error Handling & Compatibility ✅
**Improved:** Based on comprehensive testing (67% success rate → better error messages)
- Enhanced mission upload validation with clear format error messages
- Battery monitoring fallback for uncalibrated systems (voltage-based estimates)
- Firmware compatibility matrix added to documentation

### November 16, 2025 - v1.2.0 Development: Advanced Navigation & Mission Enhancements ✅
**Added:** 6 new tools for advanced flight control

**Advanced Navigation (2 tools):**
- `set_yaw` - Rotate drone to face specific direction (with cardinal directions)
- `reposition` - Move to location and loiter

**Mission Enhancements (4 tools):**
- `upload_mission` - Upload mission without auto-starting
- `download_mission` - Retrieve mission from drone
- `set_current_waypoint` - Jump to specific waypoint index
- `is_mission_finished` - Check if mission completed

**Status:** v1.2.0 nearly complete! 35 tools total (+10 from v1.1.0)

### November 16, 2025 - v1.2.0 Development: Parameter Management ✅
**Added:** 3 new parameter management tools
- `get_parameter` - Read any drone parameter with auto-type detection
- `set_parameter` - Write parameters with safety warnings
- `list_parameters` - List all parameters with optional filtering

### November 16, 2025 - Documentation Cleanup
- Removed historical development notes
- Consolidated roadmap into STATUS.md
- Streamlined documentation structure
- **Files removed:** 4 redundant MD files

- Critical safety tools (disarm, RTL, battery, hold, kill)
- System health checks
- GPS quality monitoring
- Speed and attitude telemetry
- Mission pause/resume/clear
- Absolute GPS navigation
- Speed limiting

**Impact:** Complete, safe drone operations from arm to disarm!

### November 12, 2025 - ArduPilot GUIDED Mode Fix
**Issue:** Previous implementation tried to use PX4 OFFBOARD mode on ArduPilot  
**Fix:** Updated to use ArduPilot-native GUIDED mode via `goto_location()` API

### November 2, 2025 - Relative Movement Bug Fix
